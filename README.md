# Weather app

## Details
Created using react, takes an api, deciphers it and includes information about the weather of different cities.

##What I learned
-Axios automatically converts data into json format, and is also based on promises
-Used states, one to hold the input the user enters, the other to hold the data from the api request
-Learned how to detect when a user enters a key(a specific one as well)
-Worked with ternary operators to practice
